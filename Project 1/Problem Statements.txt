Q1. We can see that in the transactions table purchase date column is written with a space. let's fix this and change the column name with an _ ,
A.  The reason why we are doing this is because date is a valid keyword in mysql so if you provide space before date , it will not be considered as an individual column in our query
rather will be treated as an keyword , hence this fi is required.

Q2. Write a query to generate a column containing only years of purchase in the transactions table.
A - When performing analysis based on only the years stated in our table , it is helpful to extract only the year. Same way we can extract month and day as well.

Q3. Write a query to showcase only the customer name and the product they purchased as per the database.
A. We will perform a join here based on the product id , as it's present in both of the tables . One point to note here is that in both tables they are written differently 
, in one table its written as product_id and in another its Purchased_Item_id so we will need to make sure to provide correct name while joining them.

Q4. Write a query to showcase the customer name , the product they purchased and total purchase value in the result
A. We will perform the same join as above to connect items and customers table but while providing the select clause we will use a multiplication of purchase quantity and item price

Q5. Write a query to display the customer name who have made more than one purchase
A. We will simply use the count method here and will chcek that if there is any two transactions where the cust_id is same or in the other words , if same cust_id gets repeated in 
two transactions.
