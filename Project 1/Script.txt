Hello everyone and welcome to this session. I hope all of you are doing great . Today we will work around on creating a mysql database as per given instructions. And once the database is created , we will perform
queries on the same. The queries that we will run will be based on the problem statements that's shared with us. I will make sure to explain each and every code to all of you so that you find no difficulty in 
understanding both the code and why the same is being used. So let's start the journey , shall we ?

The database that we will create will handle a groccery store data. The structure will be as given below -

DataBase - Groccery store
3 Tables -

Items -
    - Product Name
    - Price/unit 
    - In Stock
    - Item_id - Primary Key 

Customers -
    - Cust_name
    - Phone_num
    - Purchased_item_id
    - Purchase Qty
    - Cust_id - Primary Key

Transactions -
    - Cust_id - Primary Key
    - Transaction_id
    - Purchase_date
    - Transactions_value
    - Product Name

Now that the tables are created , we will now understand the constraints given in the code of it , INT , BIGINT simply refers to numbers , BIGINT also takes a limit of numerical
characters as a argument, NOT NULL stands for the constraint that states , in this particular column , no null values can be present , primary key refers to a particular column that 
holds uniques value in respective to that table and will be used to connect/join the table with other ones in the database.

Let's now add some values in our created tables. As you can see , we have added values in the customers table , now there are something that needs to be pointed out here.. you can see
the name harry coming twice in the data , but make sure to identify their cust_id which is differenct and hence it shows that these records are for two different individuals.
Also you can see that neville is also present twice in the data but this time their customer id is the same , which goes to show that they are same people , but the transaction id
and the item id is different , which goes to show that neville bought two different items in two transactions.

Now let's go ahead and put some data in our items table ,here value addition is pretty straight forward , different items having different Item_id and the stock here referes to their 
inventory and unit in numbers.

It's time for the transactions table , we will add values in there as well. As we can see here all the values are submitted and as discussed prior , transactions_id is considered 
as the primary key here.
